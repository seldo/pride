[LGBTQ in Tech](http://lgbtq.technology) is a community organization for LGBTQ people in the technology industry worldwide. We seek to provide professional and personal support to LGBTQ folks across a range of communities and identities -- especially for underserved groups such as PoC, neuroatypical, trans, bi/pan, and non-binary people. Selfies welcome.

We communicate mostly via [our Slack group](http://lgbtq.technology). If you identify as LGBTQ and are involved in tech, request an invite today!
